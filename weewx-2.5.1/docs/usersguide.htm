    <h1 id="about">About <span class="code">weewx</span></h1>
    <p><span class="code"><a href="http://www.weewx.com">weewx</a></span> is
      software, written in <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, that
      interacts with a weather station to produce plots, reports, and HTML
      pages. It can optionally upload the reports to a remote Web server as
      well as publish to weather services such as
      <a href="http://www.wunderground.com">WeatherUnderground</a> or
      <a href="http://www.pwsweather.com/">PWSweather.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Initial development began in the winter of 2008-2009, with the first
      release in 2009.  The SourceForge project was registered in October of
      2009.</p>
    <p><span class="code">weewx</span> is small, with under 10,000 lines of
      code, and well-documented, with over 6000 lines of comments.</p>

    <h1 id="hardware">Supported Hardware</h1>
    <p>
      Many types of station hardware are supported.  In addition to hardware support, <span class="code">weewx</span> 
      comes with a software simulator, useful for testing and evaluation.

    <h1 id="prerequisites">System Requirements</h1>

    <p>I run <span class="code">weewx</span> on a 500MHz system with an AMD
      Geode processor and 512 MB of memory. Configured this way, it
      consumes about 5% of the CPU and about 50MB of total memory. </p>
    <p>On a Marvel 500MHz ARM CPU with 512MB RAM, weewx uses 63MB virtual and
      40MB real memory when configured to generate 3 different standard
      reports.  The CPU use is typically less than 0.5%, maxxing out at
      90% for less than a minute every 5 minutes when weewx generates
      reports.</p>

    <h2>Time</h2>
    <p> You should run a <a href="http://www.ntp.org/">NTP</a> daemon on your
      server to ensure that it is synchronized with the correct time. Doing so

    <h1 id="installing">Installing <span class="code">weewx</span></h1>

    <h2>Required skills</h2>
    <p>
      In the world of open-source hobbyist software, 
      <span class="code"> weewx</span> is pretty easy to install and
      configure. There are not many package dependencies, the
      configuration is simple, and this guide includes extensive
      instructions.
      There are thousands of people who have successfully done an
      install. However, there is no "point-and-click" interface, so
      you have to do some manual configuring.
    </p>
    <p>You should have the following skills:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The patience to read and follow this guide;</li>
      <li>Willingness and ability to edit a configuration file;</li>
      <li>Some familiarity with Linux or other Unix derivatives;</li>
      <li>Ability to do simple Unix tasks such as changing file
        permissions and running commands;</li>
      <li>No programming experience is necessary unless you wish
        to extend weewx. In this case, you should have some
        familiarity with Python.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you get stuck, there is a very active <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/weewx-user">User's Group</a> to
      help, but please at least try to solve the problem yourself before posting.
    </p>

    <h2>Installation methods</h2>
    <p>
      <span class='code'>weewx</span> can be installed using the standard
      Python utility <span class='code'>setup.py</span> or it can be installed
      from a DEB or RPM package.
    </p>
    <p>
      Installation using <span class="code">setup.py</span> is the recommended
      method for those who plan to write custom services and reports for
      <span class='code'>weewx</span>.
      It will put everything in a single directory, making it easy to modify.
      If the user installing <span class='code'>weewx</span> has permission
      to write to the directory, root privileges will not be required to
      install, run, or modify <span class='code'>weewx</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By contrast, the package approach is somewhat simpler, but it requires 
      root privileges and will install the bits and pieces of 
      <span class="code">weewx</span> in standard operating system
      locations across the file system instead of in a single directory. The net effect is that
      configuration files, templates, and code will all be installed in
      separate locations, most of which will require root privileges to
      modify.</p>
	  <p>
      Here is a summary of the layout for the different install methods, along 
	  with the symbolic names used for each role. These names are used 
	  throughout the documentation. </p>

    <h1 id="configuring">Configuring <span class="code">weewx</span></h1>
    <p>This section covers configuring <span class="code">weewx</span>,
      in particular the configuration files
      <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> and
      <span class="code">skin.conf</span>. </p>

    <p>Station specific information is set in the configuration file 
      <span class="symcode">$CONFIG_ROOT</span><span class="code"><em>/weewx.conf</em></span>.
      (There is another configuration file <span class="code">skin.conf</span>
      for presentation-specific options, which is described in the
      <a href="customizing.htm">Customizing Guide</a> under section <em>
	<a href="customizing.htm#standard_skin">Reference: The 
	  standard skin configuration file</a></em>.) </p>
    <p>Most of the important options are up near the top of the file. They are
      all documented in this section, although you can safely ignore most of
      them. The truly important ones, the ones you are likely to have to
      customize for your station, are
      <span class="config_important">highlighted</span>.
    </p>
    <p>Default values are provided for many of them, meaning that if they are
      not listed in the configuration file <em>at all</em>,
      <span class="code">weewx</span> will pick sensible values. When the
      documentation below gives a &quot;default value&quot; this is what it
      means. However, all options have been given values in the configuration
      file that ships with <span class="code">weewx</span>, so you can see
      what they look like. The value given in this shipped configuration 
      file is not necessarily the same as the &quot;default value&quot;. </p>
    <p>What follows is organized by the different sections of the
      configuration file. </p>

    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>The options declared at the top are not actually part of any section.</p>
    <p class="config_option">debug </p>
    <p>Set to 1 to have the program perform extra debug checks, as well as
      emit extra information in the log file. Otherwise, set to 0. Default
      is 0 (no debug).
    </p>
    <p class="config_option">WEEWX_ROOT </p>
    <p>Set to the root directory of the <span class="code">weewx</span> file 
	hierarchy for this station. Normally, this is set automatically by the 
	installation process. Required. No default.
    </p>
    <p class="config_option">socket_timeout </p>
    <p>Set to how long to wait before declaring a socket time out. This is
      used when using FTP to send data to a web server or when sending data
      to the Weather Underground. Twenty (20) seconds is reasonable. Default
      is 20. </p>

    <h2 class="config_section">[Station]</h2>
    <p>This section covers options relating to your weather station setup. </p>
    <p class="config_important">location </p>
    <p>The station location should be a UTF-8 string that describes the
      geography of where your weather station is located. Required.
      No default.</p>
      <pre class="tty">location = A small ranch in Kentucky</pre>
	  <p>If the description contains commas, it must be enclosed
      in quotation marks.</p>
	  <pre class="tty">location = "Hood River, Oregon"</pre>
	  <p class="config_important">latitude <br />
      longitude </p>
    <p>The lat/lon should be set in decimal degrees, negative for southern and
      western hemispheres, respectively. Required. No default. </p>
    <pre class="tty">latitude = 38.8977
longitude = -77.0366</pre>
    <p class="config_option"><span class="config_important">altitude</span></p>
    <p>Normally the station altitude is downloaded from your hardware, but not
      all stations support this. Set to the altitude of the station and the
      unit used for the altitude. Example: </p>
    <pre class="tty">altitude = 700, foot</pre>
    <p>An example in meters:</p>
    <pre class="tty">altitude = 220, meter</pre>
    <p class="config_option">rain_year_start
    </p>
    <p>Normally the start of the rain year is downloaded from your hardware,
      but not all stations support this. Set to the start of your rain year,
      for example, 10, if your rain year starts in October (as mine does).
      Default is 1. </p>
    <pre class="tty">rain_year_start = 1</pre>
    <p class="config_option">week_start </p>
    <p>Start of the week. 0=Monday, 1= Tuesday, ... , 6 = Sunday. Default is 6 (Sunday)
    </p>
    <pre class="tty">week_start = 0</pre>
    <p class="config_important">station_type </p>
    <p>Set to the type of hardware you are using.</p>
    <pre class="tty">station_type = Simulator</pre>

    <p>This section is for options relating to the Davis Vantage series of hardware 
      (<em>VantagePro, VantagePro2</em> or <em>VantageVue</em>).</p>
    <p class="config_important">type </p>
    <p>Set to either <span class="code">serial</span>, for a serial or USB

      in the formula to calculate reception quality for wireless stations.
      Default is 1. </p>
    <p class="config_option">timeout </p>
    <p>How many seconds to wait for a response from the station before giving 
      up. Default is 5 seconds. </p>
    <p class="config_option">wait_before_retry </p>
    <p>How many seconds to wait before retrying. Unless you have a good reason 
      to change it, this value should be left at the default, as it is long
      enough for the station to offer new data, but not so long as to go into
      a new loop packet (which arrive every 2 seconds). Default is 1.2
      seconds. </p>
    <p class="config_option">max_tries </p>

      series of weather stations with serial connectors.</p>
    <p class="config_important">type</p>
    <p>For the moment, only <span class="code">serial</span> is supported.</p>
    <p class="config_important">port </p>
    <p>Along with the <span class="code">serial</span> option above, you 
      must set the serial port name used by the station. For example,
      <span class="code">/dev/ttyUSB0</span> is a common location for USB
      ports, <span class="code">/dev/ttyS0</span> for serial ports.
      No default. </p>
    <p class="config_option">stale_wind</p>
    <p>How long a wind record can be used to calculate wind chill (in seconds).
      Default is 30.</p>

    <h3 class="config_section">[FineOffsetUSB]</h3>
    <p>This section is for options relating to the Fine Offset series of
      weather stations with USB connectors.</p>
    <p class="config_important">model</p>
    <p>Set to the station model. For example, WH1080, WS2080, WH3081, etc. </p>
    <p class='config_option'>pressure_offset</p>
    <p>
      The offset, in millibars, that is applied to values from the
      station sensor. This offset is applied to the station pressure
      <i>before</i> calculating barometer and altimeter sea level pressures.
      Only the raw station pressure is recorded to the database, not the
      station pressure with offset applied.  Default is None.
    </p>
    <p class='config_option'>polling_mode</p>
    <p>One of <span class='code'>PERIODIC</span> or
      <span class='code'>ADAPTIVE</span>.  In
      <span class='code'>PERIODIC</span> mode,
      <span class='code'>weewx</span> queries the console at regular intervals
      determined by the <span class='code'>polling_interval</span>.
      In <span class='code'>ADAPTIVE</span> mode,
      <span class='code'>weewx</span> attempts to query the 
      console at times when it is not reading data from the sensors or writing
      data to memory.  The default is <span class='code'>PERIODIC</span>.</p>
    <p class='config_option'>polling_interval</p>
    <p>The frequency, in seconds, at which <span class='code'>weewx</span> will
      poll the console for data.  Default is 60.  This setting applies only
      when the <span class='code'>polling_mode</span> is
      <span class='code'>PERIODIC</span>.</p>

    <h3 class="config_section">[WS23xx]</h3>
    <p>This section is for options relating to the La Crosse WS-23xx series of
      weather stations.</p>
    <p class="config_important">port</p>
    <p>The serial port, e.g., <span class='code'>/dev/ttyS0</span>.  When using
      a USB-Serial converter, the port will be something like
      <span class='code'>/dev/ttyUSB0</span>.  Default is
      <span class='code'>/dev/ttyUSB0</span></p>
    <p class="config_important">model</p>
    <p>Set to the station model. For example, WS-2315, LaCrosse WS2317,
      etc.  Default is "LaCrosse WS23xx".</p>
    <p class='config_option'>pressure_offset</p>
    <p>
      The offset, in millibars, that is applied to values from the
      station sensor. This offset is applied to the station pressure
      <i>before</i> calculating barometer and altimeter sea level pressures.
      Only the raw station pressure is recorded to the database, not the
      station pressure with offset applied.  Default is None.
    </p>
    <p class='config_option'>polling_interval</p>
    <p>The <span class="code">polling_interval</span> determines how often
      <span class="code">weewx</span> will query the station for data.  If no
      <span class="code">polling_interval</span> is specified (the default),
      <span class="code">weewx</span> will automatically use a polling interval
      based on the type of connection between the station and the sensors
      (wired or wireless). When connected with a wire, the console updates
      sensor data every 8 seconds.  When connected wirelessly, the console
      updates from 16 to 128 seconds, depending on sensor activity.
    </p>

    <h3 class='config_section'>[WS28xx]</h3>
    <p>This section is for options relating to the La Crosse WS-28xx series of
      weather stations.</p>
    <p class="config_important">transceiver_frequency</p>
    <p>Radio frequency to use between USB transceiver and console. Specify
      either US or EU.  US uses 915 MHz, EU uses 868.3 MHz.  Default is US.
    </p>
    <p class="config_important">model</p>
    <p>Set to the station model. For example, LaCrosse WS2810, TFA Primus,
      etc.  Default is "LaCrosse WS28xx".</p>
    <p class='config_option'>pressure_offset</p>
    <p>
      The offset, in millibars, that is applied to values from the
      station sensor. This offset is applied to the station pressure
      <i>before</i> calculating barometer and altimeter sea level pressures.
      Only the raw station pressure is recorded to the database, not the
      station pressure with offset applied.  Default is None.

    <h3 class="config_section">[TE923]</h3>
    <p>This section is for options relating to the Hideki TE923 series of
      weather stations.</p>
    <p class="config_important">model</p>
    <p>Set to the station model. For example, Meade TE923W or TFA Nexus.
      Default is "TE923".</p>
    <p class="config_option">sensor_map</p>
    <p>This option defines the mapping between temperature/humidity values in
      the database and the remote sensors.  Up to 5 remote sensors are
      supported.  A switch on each sensor determines which of 5 channels that
      sensor will use.  For example, if the switch on the sensor is set to 3,
      the temperature from that sensor will be t_3 and the humidity from that
      sensor will be h_3.
    </p>
    <p>The default mapping is:
    </p>
    <pre class="tty">[[sensor_map]]
    outTemp =     t_1
    outHumidity = h_1
    extraTemp1 =  t_2

    extraTemp4 =  t_5
    extraHumid4 = h_5</pre>
    <p class="config_option">battery_map</p>
    <p>This option defines the mapping between battery status values in
      the database and the remote sensors.  The default mapping is:
    </p>
    <pre class="tty">[[battery_map]]
    txBatteryStatus =      batteryUV
    windBatteryStatus =    batteryWind
    rainBatteryStatus =    batteryRain

    extraBatteryStatus3 =  battery4
    extraBatteryStatus4 =  battery5</pre>

    <h3 class="config_section">[Simulator]</h3>
    <p>This section is for options relating to the software weather station simulator 
      that comes with <span class="code">weewx</span>.</p>
    <p class="config_option">loop_interval</p>
    <p>The time (in seconds) between emitting loop packets. Default is 2.5</p>
    <p class="config_option">mode</p>
    <p>One of either <span class='code'>simulator</span> or <span class='code'>generator</span>.  Default is <span class='code'>simulator</span>.</p>

    <p>A comma separated list of servers:ports to try. Unless you have a good
      reason to change this, use the servers listed. Required.</p>
    <p class="config_option">interval </p>
    <p>The interval in seconds between posts. Because CWOP is heavily used, the
      operators discourage very frequent posts. Every 5 minutes (300 seconds)
      is fine, but they prefer every 10 minutes (600 s) or even longer. Setting
      this value to zero will cause every archive record to be posted. 
      Optional. Default is zero.</p>
    <p class="config_option">stale </p>
    <p>How old a record can be before it will not be used for a catch up. CWOP
      does not use the timestamp on a posted record. Instead, they use the wall
      clock time that it came in. This means that if your station is off the
      air for a long period of time, then <span class="code">weewx</span>
      attempts a catch up, old data could be interpreted as the current
      conditions. Optional. Default is 1800 seconds.</p>

    <h3 class="config_section">[[StationRegistry]]</h3>
    <p>
      A registry of weewx weather stations is maintained at <span class="code">weewx.com</span>.
      Stations are displayed on a map and a list at <a
        href="http://weewx.com/stations.html">http://weewx.com/stations.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>How does the registry work? Individual weather stations
      periodically contact the registry. Each station provides a URL to
      identify itself, plus other information such as the station type
      and weewx version. The registry does not keep track of
      meteorological data; no information about the weather is sent to
      the registry.</p>
    <p>To add your station to this list, enable the StationRegistry
      in weewx.conf. Your station will contact the registry once per
      week. If your station does not contact the registry for about a
      month, it will be removed from the list.</p>

    <h2 class="config_section">[StdReport]</h2>
    <p>This section is for configuring the <span class="code">StdReport</span> service, 
      which controls which reports are to be generated. While it can be highly customized 
      for your individual situation, this documentation describes the section as shipped 
      in the standard distribution. </p>
    <p>Each report is represented by a sub-section, marked with double brackets 
      (<em>e.g.</em>, <span class="code">[[MyReport]]</span>). Any options for the 
      report should be placed under it. The standard report service will go through 
      the sections, running each report in order. Hence, normally the report
      <span class="code">[[StandardReport]]</span> will be run first, then report
      <span class="code">[[FTP]]</span> (which actually optionally uploads the results 
      to a remote web server). Details for how to customize reports are in the section
      <em><a href="customizing.htm#reports">Opportunities 
	  for customizing reports</a></em>, in the 
      <a href="customizing.htm">Customizing Guide</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="config_option">SKIN_ROOT </p>
    <p>The directory where the skins live. A relative path is relative to

    <p class="config_option">HTML_ROOT </p>
    <p>The target directory for the generated files. A relative path is
      relative to <span class="symcode">$WEEWX_ROOT</span>. Generated 
	files and images will be put here. </p>
    <h3 class="config_section">[[StandardReport]]</h3>
    <p>This is the standard report that will be run on every archiving interval. 
      It uses the skin &quot;<span class="code">Standard</span>&quot;, which generates 
      four HTML pages (&quot;day&quot;, &quot;week&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, and &quot;year&quot; 
      observations), plot graphs for same, an RSS feed, and NOAA monthly and yearly 
      reports. Unless changed otherwise, it uses US Customary Units and puts the results 
      in <span class="code">public_html</span> and subdirectory <span class="code">
	public_html/NOAA</span>. </p>
    <h3 class="config_section">[[FTP]]</h3>
    <p>While this &quot;report&quot; does not actually generate anything, it 
      uses the report machinery to upload files from directory <span class="symcode">
	$HTML_ROOT</span> to a remote webserver. It does an incremental update, 
      that is, it only FTPs any files that have changed, saving the outgoing bandwidth 
      of your Internet connection. </p>
    <p>If you do not use such a server, comment out the first four options below.
    </p>
    <p class="config_important">user </p>
    <p>Set to the username you use for your FTP connection to your web server. Required. 
      No default. </p>
    <p class="config_important">password </p>
    <p>Set to the password you use for your FTP connection to your web server. Required. 
      No default. </p>
    <p class="config_important">server </p>
    <p>Set to the name of your web server (<em>e.g.</em>, <span class="code">www.threefools.org</span>, 
    in my case). Required. No default </p>
    <p class="config_important">path </p>
    <p>Set to the path where the weather data will be stored on your webserver (<em>e.g.</em>, <span class="code">/weather</span>). 
      NB: some FTP servers require a leading slash (&#39;<span class="code">/</span>&#39;), 
      some do not. Required. No default. </p>
    <p class="config_important">passive </p>
    <p>Set to 1 if you wish to use the more modern, FTP passive mode, 0 if you wish 
      to use active mode. Passive mode generally works better through firewalls, but 
      not all FTP servers do a good job of supporting it. See
      <a href="http://slacksite.com/other/ftp.html">Active FTP vs. Passive FTP, a 
	Definitive Explanation</a> for a good explanation of the difference. Default 
      is 1 (passive mode). </p>
    <p class="config_option">max_tries </p>
    <p><span class="code">Weewx</span> will try up to this many times to FTP a file 
      up to your server before giving up. Default is 3. </p>
    <h3 class="config_section">[[RSYNC]]</h3>
    <p>While this &quot;report&quot; does not actually generate anything, it 
      uses the report machinery to upload files from directory <span class="symcode">
	$HTML_ROOT</span> to a remote webserver. It does an incremental update, 
      that is, it only synchronizes those files that have changed, saving the outgoing 
      bandwidth of your Internet connection. </p>
    <p>If you do not use such a server, comment out the options below. </p>
    <p class="config_important">server </p>
    <p>Set to the name of your web server (<em>e.g.</em>,
      <a href="http://www.threefools.org">www.threefools.org</a>, in my case). Required. 
      No default </p>
    <p class="config_important">user </p>
    <p>Set to the ssh username you use for your rsync connection to your web server. 
      The local user that weewx runs as must have passwordless ssh configured for 
      user@server. Required. No default. </p>
    <p class="config_important">path </p>
    <p>Set to the path where the weather data will be stored on your webserver (<em>e.g.</em>, <span class="code">/weather</span>). 
      Required. No default. </p>
    <p class="config_important">delete </p>
    <p>Files that don't exist in the local report are removed from the remote location.
      <em>USE WITH CAUTION:</em> If you make a mistake in setting the
      <span class="code">path</span>, this can cause unexpected files to be deleted 
      on the remote server. Valid values are 1 to enable and 0 to disable. Required. 
      Default is 0.</p>
    <h2 class="config_section" id="StdConvert">[StdConvert]</h2>
    <p>This section is for configuring the <span class="code">StdConvert</span> 
      service. This service acts as a filter, converting the unit system coming off 
      your hardware to a target output unit system. Everything that follows, including 
      the archiving service, will use the target unit system. Hence, your data 
      will be stored using your chosen unit system. </p>
    <p><em>Once chosen, it cannot be changed!</em> Weewx does not allow you to mix 
      unit systems within the databases. You must chose one or the other and then 
      stick with it. This means that users coming from wview (which uses US Customary) 
      should not change the default setting. Having said this, there is a way of reconfiguring 
      the database to use another unit system. See the section
      <a href="customizing.htm#Changing_the_unit_system">Changing the unit system</a> 
      in the Customizing Guide.</p>
    <p>Note that whatever you choose here, it does not affect your options for the 
      unit system to be used for <i>reporting</i>. Because of this, unless you 
      have a special purpose application, there is really no good reason to change 
      from the default, which is <span class="code">US</span>. </p>
	  <p class="warning"><strong>Warning!</strong><br />
	  If, despite these precautions, you do 
      decide to change to Metric, be sure to read the sections <span class="code">
	<a href="#StdCalibrate">[StdCalibrate]</a></span> and <span class="code">
	<a href="#StdQC">[StdQC]</a></span> below, and change the units there as well!</p>
    <p class="config_option">target_unit</p>
    <p>Set to either <span class="code">US</span> or <span class="code">METRIC</span>. 
      Default is <span class="code">US</span>.</p>
    <h2 class="config_section" id="StdCalibrate">[StdCalibrate]</h2>
    <p>This section is for configuring the <span class="code">StdCalibrate</span> 
      service. This service offers an opportunity to correct for any calibration errors 
      in your instruments. It is very general and flexible. </p>
    <p>Because this service is normally run after <span class="code">StdConvert</span>, 
      the units to be used should be the same as the target unit system chosen in
      <a href="#StdConvert"><span class="code">StdConvert</span></a> above. It is 
      also important that this service be run before the archiving service
      <span class="code">StdArchive</span>, so that it is the corrected data that 
      is stored. </p>
    <p>If you do not wish to apply any calibrations, you can leave it out of
      <span class="code"><a href="#service_list">service_list</a></span>, the list 
      of services to be run, and it will not be loaded or run at all. </p>
    <h3 class="config_section">[[Corrections]]</h3>
    <p>In this section you list all <em>correction expressions</em>. For example, 
      say that you know your outside thermometer reads high by 0.2&deg;F. You could add 
      the expression: </p>
    <p class='tty'>outTemp = outTemp - 0.2</p>
    <p>Perhaps you need a linear correction around a reference temperature of 68&deg;F:
    </p>
    <p class='tty'>outTemp = outTemp + (outTemp-68) * 0.02</p>
    <p>It is even possible to do corrections involving more than one variable. Suppose 
      you have a temperature sensitive barometer: </p>
    <p class='tty'>barometer = barometer + (outTemp-32) * 0.0091</p>
    <p>All correction expressions are run in the order given. </p>
    <p>Both LOOP data and archive data will be corrected. </p>
    <p>If you are using a Davis Vantage instrument and all you require is a simple 
      correction offset, this can also be done in the hardware. See your manual for 
      instructions. </p>
    <h2 class="config_section" id="StdQC">[StdQC]</h2>
    <p>This section is for configuring the <span class="code">StdQC</span> service. 
      This service offers a very simple <em>Quality Control</em> that only checks 
      that values are within a minimum and maximum range.</p>
    <p>Because this service is normally run after <span class="code">StdConvert</span>, 
      the units to be used should be the same as the target unit system chosen in
      <a href="#StdConvert"><span class="code">StdConvert</span></a>. It is also 
      important that it be run after the calibration service, <span class="code">StdCalibrate
      </span>and before the archiving service <span class="code">StdArchive</span>, 
      so that it is the calibrated and corrected data that is stored. </p>
    <p>If you do not wish to use this service, you can leave it out of
      <span class="code"><a href="#service_list">service_list</a></span>, the list 
      of services to be run, and it will not be loaded or run. </p>
    <h3 class="config_section">[[MinMax]]</h3>
    <p>In this section you list the observation types you wish to have checked, 
      along with their minimum and maximum values. The units should be in <em>the 
	same unit system as specified in section <span class="code">
	  <a href="#StdConvert">StdConvert</a></span> above</em>. </p>
    <p>Example, </p>
    <pre class="tty">[[MinMax]]
    outTemp = -40, 120
    barometer = 28, 32.5
    outHumidity = 0, 100 </pre>
    <p>In this example, if a temperature should fall outside of the inclusive range 
      -40 &deg;F through 120 &deg;F, then it will be set to the null value,
      <span class="code">None</span>, and ignored. In a similar manner, the acceptable 
      values for barometric pressure would be 28 through 32.5 inHg, for humidity 0 
      through 100%. </p>
    <p>Both LOOP and archive data will be checked. </p>
    <p>Knowing the details of how your hardware encodes data helps to minimize the 
      number of observations that need to be checked. For example, the VP2 devotes 
      only one unsigned byte to storing wind speed, and even then
      <span class="code">0xff</span> is devoted to a bad value, so the only possible 
      values that could appear are 0 through 126 mph, a reasonable range. So, for 
      the VP2, there is no real point in checking wind speed. </p>
    <h2 class="config_section" id="StdArchive">[StdArchive]</h2>
    <p>This section is for configuring <span class="code">StdArchive</span>, the 
      service that stores data in the databases. Options allow choosing which database 
      to use for archiving and statistics.</p>
    <p class="config_option">archive_database</p>
    <p>The database to be used to store the archive data. This should match a section 
      given in the section <span class="code"><a href="#Databases">[Databases]</a></span> 
      below. Normally, this is set to <span class="code">archive_sqlite</span>. If 
      you are using MySQL, you will want to change this to <span class="code">
	archive_mysql</span>.</p>
    <p class="config_option">stats_database</p>
    <p>The database to be used to store the statistical data. This should match 
      a section given in the section <span class="code"><a href="#Databases">[Databases]</a></span> 
      below. Normally, this is set to <span class="code">stats_sqlite</span>. If 
      you are using MySQL, you will want to change this to <span class="code">
	stats_mysql</span>.</p>
    <p class="config_option">archive_delay </p>
    <p>How long to wait in seconds after the top of an archiving interval before 
      fetching new data off the station. For example, if your archive interval is 
      5 minutes and archive_delay is set to 15, then the data will be fetched at 00:00:15, 
      00:05:15, 00:10:15, etc. This delay is to give the station a few seconds to 
      archive the data internally, and in case your server has any other tasks to 
      do at the top of the minute. Default is 15 seconds. </p>
    <p class="config_option" id="record_generation">record_generation</p>
    <p>Set to whether records should be downloaded off the hardware (recommended), 
      or generated in software. If set to '<span class="code">hardware</span>', then
      <span class="code">weewx</span> tries to download archive records from your 
      station. However, not all types of stations support this, in which case
      <span class="code">weewx</span> falls back to software generation. A setting 
      of '<span class="code">hardware</span>' will work for most users. A notable 
      exception is <a href="http://www.wxforum.net/index.php?topic=10315.0">users 
	who have cobbled together homebrew serial interfaces</a> for the Vantage stations 
      that do not include memory for a logger. These users should set this option 
      to '<span class="code">software</span>', forcing software record generation. 
      Default is <span class="code">hardware</span>.</p>
	  <p class="config_option">loop_hilo</p>
	  <p>Set to <span class="code">True</span> to have LOOP data and archive 
	  data to be used for high / low statistics. Set to <span class="code">False</span> 
	  to have only archive data used. If your sensor emits lots of spiky data, 
	  setting to <span class="code">False</span> may help. Default is
	  <span class="code">True</span>.</p>
    <p class="config_option">archive_schema</p>
    <p>This is used only when the archive database is first created. Thereafter, 
      it is downloaded from the database. It should point to a Python list 
      containing the archive database schema. The default is <span class="code">
	user.schemas.defaultArchiveSchema</span>.</p>
    <p class="config_option">stats_schema</p>
    <p>This is used only when the stats database is first created. Thereafter, 
      it is downloaded from the database. It should point to a Python list 
      containing the stats database schema. The default is <span class="code">
	user.schemas.defaultStatsSchema</span>.</p>
    
    <h2 class="config_section">[StdTimeSynch]</h2>
    <p>This section is for configuring <span class="code">StdTymeSynch</span>, a 
      service that can synchronize the onboard clock of station with your computer. 
      Not all weather station hardware supports this.</p>
    <p class="config_option">clock_check</p>
    <p>How often to check the clock on the weather station in seconds. Default is 
      14,400 seconds (every 4 hours)</p>
    <p class="config_option">max_drift</p>
    <p>The maximum amount of clock drift to tolerate, in seconds, before resetting 
      the clock. Default is 5.</p>
    <h2 class="config_section" id="Databases">[Databases]</h2>
    <p>This section lists actual database bindings. The name of each database is 
      given in double brackets below (for example, <span class="code">[[archive_sqlite]]</span>). 
      The details of the binding follow. You are free to add new bindings.</p>
    <p>Note that if you choose the <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database 
      it is assumed that you know how to administer it. In particular, you will have

    <p>This section is used to configure the internal service engine in

    <p>This section is for options used by the service engine. </p>
    <p class="config_option" id="service_list">service_list </p>
    <p>This option is the list of <em>services</em> that are to be run by the service 
      engine. After each event (such as the arrival of LOOP data, etc.), they will 
      be run in the given order. The standard list of services run by weewx is:
    </p>
    <pre class='tty' style='white-space:pre-line'>service_list = weewx.wxengine.StdConvert, weewx.wxengine.StdCalibrate, weewx.wxengine, StdQC, weewx.wxengine.StdArchive, weewx.wxengine.StdTimeSynch, weewx.wxengine.StdPrint, weewx.wxengine.StdRESTful, weewx.wxengine.StdReport</pre>
    <p>Note that despite how it may or may not read above, this option must be <em>all on one line!</em> </p>
    <p>You can leave some of these services out if you do not need them. For example, 
      the bare minimum if you are using a Davis Vantage instrument, storing your data 
      in US Customary units, doing no data corrections or quality control and running 
      as a daemon (no printing to console) would be:</p>
    <pre class="tty" style='white-space:pre-line'>service_list = weewx.wxengine.StdArchive, weewx.wxengine.StdTimeSynch, weewx.wxengine.StdRESTful, weewx.wxengine.StdReport</pre>
    <p>However, this will only make a slight difference in execution speed. </p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Highlighted</span> values can be changed.</p>
    <p>For example, to change the archive interval to 10 minutes (600 seconds):</p>
    <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_vantage --set-interval=600</pre>
    <p>To set the time zone code to Central European Time (code 20):</p>
    <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_vantage --set-tz-code=20</pre>
    <p class="warning">You can set either the time zone code <em>or</em> the 
	time zone offset, but not both. </p>
	  <p>Other parameters can be set in a similar manner.</p>
    <h3>Archive Interval</h3>
    <p>Valid archive intervals are 60, 300, 600, 900, 1800, 3600, and 7200. However, 
      if you are ftp&#39;ing lots of files to a server, setting it to 60 seconds may 
      not give enough time to have them all uploaded before the next archive record 
      is due. If this is the case, you should pick an archive interval of at least 
      300 seconds, or trim the number of files you are using. </p>
    <p>I have found that a five minute (300 seconds) archive interval works well 
      for the Vantage stations. Because of the large amount of onboard memory they carry, 
      going to a larger interval does not have any real advantages. </p>
    <p><em>Choose your archiving interval carefully! </em>Once chosen, it cannot 
      be changed without messing up your statistics (highs and lows will be OK, but 
      averages and rms wind speed will be wrong). </p>
    <h3>Rain bucket type</h3>
    <p>Normally, this is set by Davis, but if you have replaced your bucket with 
      a different kind, you might want to reconfigure. For example, to change to a 
      0.1MM bucket (bucket code &quot;2&quot;), use the following:</p>
    <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_vantage --set-bucket=2</pre>
    <h3>Dumping the logger memory</h3>
	  <p>Generally, <span class="code">weewx</span> downloads only new archive 
	  records from the on-board logger in the Vantage. However, occasionally the 
	  memory in the Vantage will get corrupted, making this impossible. See the 
	  troubleshooting section below <em>"<a href="#html_generated_but_not_updated">Weewx 
	  generates HTML pages, but it does not update them</a></em>". The 
	  fix involves clearing the memory but, unfortunately, this means you may 
	  lose any data which might have accumulated in the logger memory, but not 
	  yet downloaded. By using the <span class="code">--dump</span> command 
	  before clearing the memory, you might be able to save these data. </p>
    <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_vantage --dump</pre>
	  <p>This will dump all data archived in the Vantage memory directly to the 
	  database, without regard to whether or not they have been seen before. 
	  Because the command dumps <em>all</em> data, it may result in many 
	  duplicate primary key errors. These can be ignored.</p>

    <h3>Calibrating the pressure sensor</h3>
    <p>The pressure sensor in Fine Offset stations measures absolute, or station pressure.  The sensor pressure may be off a bit when the station is at sea level, and almost certainly will be off when the station is above sea level.  Stations at sea level are typically off by 1 to 10 millibars, while stations above a few hundred meters may be off by hundreds of millibars.  When reporting weather data, <span class='code'>weewx</span> will calculate the equivalent sea level pressure, but the pressure sensor must be calibrated and an altitude must be specified.</p>
    <p>To calibrate the pressure sensor, specify a <span class='code'>pressure_offset</span>, in millibars, in <span class='code'>weewx.conf</span>.  If you do not know what the offset should be, use the <span class='code'>wee_config_fousb</span> 
	utility to calculate this offset given the station altitude and a valid 
	sea-level pressure from a nearby known-correct station.</p>
    <p>For example, if the sea level pressure from a verified source is 1003.048 hPa, the following example will calculate the offset then ask whether to insert it into <span class='code'>weewx.conf</span>.  It uses the altitude specified in <span class='code'>weewx.conf</span> and the station pressure and temperature.</p>
    <p class='tty'><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_fousb --slp=1003.048</p>
    <p>The output will look something like this:</p>
    <p class='tty'>Querying the station...
Pressure offset is None
Set pressure offset to 1.247000 hPa (y/n)? y
Pressure offset is now 1.247000</p>
    <p>For those using Imperial units, to convert inHg to hPa (mbar), multiply by 33.86389</p>
    <p><span class='code'>weewx</span> does not use the <i>relative pressure</i> in the Fine Offset console.</p>
    <p>To display sensor, relative, and calculated pressures:</p>
    <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_fousb --check-pressures</pre>

    <h3>Dumping the console memory</h3>
    <p>Fine Offset stations store records in a circular buffer - once the buffer fills, the oldest records are replaced by newer records.  The 1080 and 2080 consoles store up to 4080 records.  The 3080 consoles store up to 3264 records.  The <span class='code'>data_count</span> indicates how many records are in memory.  The <span class='code'>read_period</span> indicates the number of minutes between records.  <span class='code'>wee_config_fousb</span> can display these records in space-delimited, raw bytes, or dictionary format.</p>
    <p>For example, to display the most recent 30 records from the console memory:</p>
    <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_fousb --history=30</pre>
    <p>To clear the console memory:</p>
    <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_fousb --clear-memory</pre>

    <h3>Checking the USB quality</h3>
    <p>Use the <span class='code'>wee_config_fousb</span> utility to test the quality of the USB connection between computer and console.  Poor quality USB cables, under-powered USB hubs, and other devices on the bus can interfere with communication.</p>
    <p>To test the quality of the USB connection to the console:</p>
    <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_fousb --check-usb</pre>
    <p>Let the utility run for at least a few minutes, or possibly an hour or two.  It is not unusual to see a few bad reads in an hour, but if you see many bad reads within a few minutes, consider replacing the USB cable, USB hub, or removing other devices from the bus.</p>

    <h3>Polling Interval</h3>
    <p>When reading 'live' data, <span class='code'>weewx</span> can read as fast as possible, or at a user-defined period.  This is controlled by the <span class='code'>polling_mode</span> parameter.
    </p>
    <table class='indent'>
      <tr>
        <td width='15%'>Mode</td>

          <p class='tty' style='margin:0'>[FineOffsetUSB]
    polling_mode = ADAPTIVE</p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>In this mode, <span class='code'>weewx</span> reads data from the station as often as possible, but at intervals that avoid communication between the console and the sensors.  Nominally this results in reading data every 48 seconds.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>PERIODIC</td>
        <td>
          <p class='tty' style='margin:0'>[FineOffsetUSB]
    polling_mode = PERIODIC
    polling_interval = 60</p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>In this mode, <span class='code'>weewx</span> reads data from the station every <span class='code'>polling_interval</span> seconds.</p>
          <p>The console reads the sensors every 48 seconds (60 seconds for UV), so setting the <span class='code'>polling_interval</span> to a value less than 48 will result in duplicate readings.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Archive Record Generation</h3>
    <p>When <span class='code'>weewx</span> starts up it will attempt to download all records from the console since the last record in the archive database.
    </p>
    <p>To obtain archive records, <span class='code'>weewx</span> can read archive records from the station console, or calculate archive records independent of the station memory.  This is controlled by the <span class='code'>record_generation</span> parameter.
    </p>
    <p>The <span class='code'>archive_interval</span> should always be greater than the <span class='code'>polling_interval</span>. If the <span class='code'>polling_mode</span> is <span class='code'>PERIODIC</span> and the <span class='code'>polling_interval</span> is greater than the <span class='code'>archive_interval</span>, the archive records will be collected/calculated at every polling interval, not at every archive interval.
    </p>

    <h3>Station Characteristics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The 10xx and 20xx stations can save up to 4080 historical readings.
        That is about 85 days of data with the default recording interval of
        30 minutes, or about 14 days with a recording interval of 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>The 30xx stations can save up to 3264 historical readings.</li>
      <li>The station reads data from the sensors every 48 seconds.</li>
      <li>The 30xx stations read UV data every 60 seconds.</li>

    <h3>Dumping the console memory</h3>
    <p>La Crosse 23xx stations store records in a circular buffer - once the
      buffer fills, the oldest records are replaced by newer records.  The
      console stores up to 175 records.
      The <span class='code'>history number of records</span> indicates how
      many records are in memory.  The
      <span class='code'>history interval</span> indicates the number of
      minutes between records.</p>
    <p>For example, to display the latest 30 records from the console memory:</p>
    <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_ws23xx --history=30</pre>
    <p>To clear the console memory:</p>
    <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_ws23xx --clear-memory</pre>

    <h3>Archive Record Generation</h3>
    <p>When <span class='code'>weewx</span> starts up it will attempt to
      download all records from the console since the last record in the
      archive database.
    </p>
    <p>To obtain archive records, <span class='code'>weewx</span> can read
      archive records from the station console, or calculate archive records
      independent of the station memory.  This is controlled by the
      <span class='code'>record_generation</span> parameter.
    </p>

    <h3>Station Characteristics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The station does not record wind gust or wind gust direction.</li>
      <li>The station has 175 history records.  That is just over 7 days
        of data with the default history recording interval of 60 minutes, 
        or about 14 hours with a recording interval of 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Changing the recording interval will clear the station memory.</li>
      <li>The station calculates windchill and dewpoint.  The WS23xx driver
        includes options to calculate windchill and dewpoint in weewx, since
        the hardware algorithms may be antiquated.</li>
      <li>The hardware interface is a serial port, but USB-serial converters
        can be used with computers that have no serial port.  Beware that
        not every type of USB-serial converter will work.  Converters based
        on ATEN UC-232A chipset are known to work.</li>

      <span class='highlight'>&nbsp;highlighted&nbsp;</span> options
      are working.</p>

    <h3>Pairing</h3>
    <p>The console and transceiver must be paired.  Pairing ensures that your
      transceiver is talking to your console, not your neighbor's console.
      Pairing should only have to be done once.  You might have to pair again
      after power cycling the console, for example when you replace the
      batteries.</p>
    <p>There are two ways to pair the console and the transceiver:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>The WeeWX way.</strong>  With weewx running, press and hold
        the [v] button on the console until you see 'PC' in the display.  If
        the console pairs with the transceiver, 'PC' will go away within a
        second or two.</li>
      <li><strong>The HeavyWeather way.</strong>  Follow the pairing
        instructions that came with the station.  You will have to run
        HeavyWeather on a windows computer with the USB transceiver.  After
        HeavyWeather indicates the devices are paired, put the USB transceiver
        in your weewx computer and start weewx.  Do not power cycle the
        station console or you will have to start over.</li>
      </ol>

    <p>If the console does not pair, you will see messages in the log such as
      this:</p>
    <pre class='tty'>ws28xx: RFComm: message from console contains unknown device ID (id=165a resp=80 req=6)</pre>
    <p>Either approach to pairing may require multiple attempts.</p>

    <h3>Synchronizing</h3>
    <p>The transceiver and console must be synchronized in order to
      communicate.  Synchronization will happen automatically at the top of
      each hour, or you can force synchronization by pressing the [SET] button
      momentarily.  Do not press and hold the [SET] button - that
      modifies the console alarms.</p>
    <p>When the transceiver and console are synchronized, you will see lots of
      'ws28xx: RFComm' messages in the log when debug=1.  When the devices are
      not synchronized, you will see messages like this about every 10
      minutes:</p>
      <pre class='tty'>Nov  7 19:12:17 raspi weewx[2335]: ws28xx: MainThread: no contact with console</pre>
    <p>If you see this, or if you see an extended gap in the weather data
      in the weewx plots, press momentarily the [SET] button, or wait until
      the top of the hour.</p>
    <p>When the transceiver has not received new data for awhile, you will see
      messages like this in the log:</p>
    <pre class='tty'>Nov  7 19:12:17 raspi weewx[2335]: ws28xx: MainThread: no new weather data</pre>
    <p>If you see 'no new weather data' messages with the
      'no contact with console' messages,
      it simply means that the transceiver has not been able to synchronize
      with the console.  If you see only the 'no new weather data' messages,
      then the sensors are not communicating with the console, or the console
      may be defective.</p>

    <h3>Alarms</h3>
    <p>Be sure to turn off all alarms in the console.  When an alarm goes off,
      communication with the transceiver stops.  It is better to create alarms
      in weewx, and the weewx alarms can do much more than the console alarms
      anyway.</p>


    <h1 id="configuring_mysql">Configuring MySQL</h1>
    <p>This section applies only for those using MySQL.</p>
    <p>Assuming that you want to use the default database configuration, your
      <span class="code"><a href="#Databases">[Databases]</a></span> section 
      should 
      look something like this:</p>
    <pre class="tty">[Databases]
  [[archive_mysql]]
      host = localhost
      user = weewx
      password = weewx
      database = weewx
      driver = weedb.mysql
      
  [[stats_mysql]]
      host = localhost
      user = weewx
      password = weewx
      database = stats
      driver = weedb.mysql</pre>
    <p>This assumes user '<span class="code">weewx</span>' would have password '<span class="code">weewx</span>'. 
      Adjust as necessary.</p>
    <p>If you wish, databases '<span class="code">weewx</span>' and '<span class="code">stats</span>' 
      can be combined into one database, although this will make it harder to drop 
      the latter should you need to rebuild the stats database at a later time.</p>
    <p>You will need to give the necessary permissions for databases '<span class="code">weewx</span>' 
      and '<span class="code">stats</span>' to whatever MySQL user you choose, by 
      default, user '<span class="code">weewx</span>'. Here are the necessary minimum 
      permissions:</p>
    <pre class="tty">mysql&gt; CREATE USER 'weewx'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'weewx';
mysql&gt; GRANT select, update, create, delete, insert ON weewx.* TO weewx@localhost;
mysql&gt; GRANT select, update, create, delete, insert ON stats.* TO weewx@localhost</pre>
    <p>In addition to configuring MySQL, you will also need to indicate to
      <span class="code">weewx</span> that you intend to use the configured 
	  database. See section <span class="code"><a href="#StdArchive">
	  [StdArchive]</a></span> for details.</p>

    <h1 id="running">Running <span class="code">weewx</span></h1>
    <p><span class="code">Weewx</span> can be run either from the command line (useful 
      for diagnostic purposes because it will print out a summary of every LOOP data), 
      or as a daemon. When first trying <span class="code">weewx</span>, it is 
      probably best to run it from the command line because you will be able to see 
      command line diagnostics, as well as log messages. </p>
    <h2>Running from the command line</h2>
    <p><span class="code">Weewx</span> can easily be run from the command line. 
      Start by making sure you have appropriate permissions to the serial port your 
      weather station uses. For example, if you are using a plain old serial port:
    </p>
    <pre class="tty">sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0 </pre>
    <p>Then run the main program, <span class="code">weewxd</span>, giving 
      the configuration file as its only parameter: </p>
    <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/weewxd <span class="symcode">$CONFIG_ROOT</span>/weewx.conf</pre>
    <p>It should start by downloading any data stored in your weather station into 
      the archive database. As the Davis VantagePro can store a couple thousand archive 
      records internally, this could take a minute or two. I have found this process 
      particularly slow on SuSE for some reason. </p>
    <p><span class="code">Weewx</span> will then start monitoring LOOP data, printing 
      a short version of the received data on standard output, about once every two 
      seconds. </p>
    <p>You can tell a running instance of <span class="code">weewx</span> to reread 
      its configuration file by sending it the <span class="code">HUP</span> signal. 
      First run <span class="code">ps</span> to find out the Process ID (PID) number 
      of the instance, then send it the <span class="code">HUP</span> signal: </p>
    <pre class="tty">ps -a          # Note the PID of the weewxd process
kill -HUP <em>pid</em>  # Send it a HUP signal</pre>
    <p>Note that this <em>only</em> rereads the configuration file. It will not 
      reload any code.</p>
    <h2>Running as a daemon</h2>
    <p>For unattended operations it is best to have <span class="code">weewx</span> 
      run as a daemon, started automatically when the server is rebooted. </p>
    <p>If you use a packaged install from a DEB or RPM distribution, this is

    <h2>sqlite3</h2>
    <p>The sqlite3 archive database used by <span class="code">weewx</span>
      (nominally, <span class="code">weewx.sdb</span>) is completely
      compatible with the database used by
      <a href="http://www.wviewweather.com">wview</a> (usually called
      <span class="code">wview-archive.sdb</span>), at least as of wview
      Version 5.2.X. The schema and its semantics is identical. However, the
      statistical file <span class="code">stats.sdb</span> is different, and
      must be rebuilt. This will be done automatically on startup by
      <span class="code">weewx</span>.
    </p>
    <p>If you have data from <span class='code'>wview</span>, you can
      'import' them into <span class='code'>weewx</span> by simply copying the 
	sqlite database
      file.  Assuming that the <span class='code'>wview</span> data are in file <span class='code'>/var/wview/archive/wview-archive.sdb</span>,</p>
    <p class='tty'>sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop

cp /var/wview/archive/wview-archive.sdb weewx.sdb
sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start</p>
    <p>When <span class='code'>weewx</span> starts it will generate a new
      <span class='code'>stats.sdb</span> file.  This could take awhile if the
      <span class='code'>wview</span> archive contains more than a month or
      two of data.</p>
    <p>On my modest 500 MHz <a href="http://www.fit-pc.com/">fit-PC Slim</a>
      with 512 MB of memory it took a little over 4 minutes for a year and a
      half (25 MB) of data.</p>
    <h2>MySQL</h2>
    <p>The MySQL archive database used by wview is "almost" compatible with
      <span class="code">weewx</span>. The one difference is that in wview, the column '<span class="code">interval</span>' 
      is named '<span class="code">arcInt</span>' (presumably because
      <span class="code">interval</span> is a keyword in MySQL, although it can 
      still be used by surrounding the word with backquotes). </p>
    <p>To change the column name to what <span class="code">weewx</span> uses, namely <span class="code">interval</span>, 
      use the utility <span class="code">mysql</span> and issue the command:</p>
	  <pre class="tty">ALTER TABLE <em>your-wview-archive-name</em> CHANGE arcInt `interval` INTEGER NOT NULL; </pre>
    <p>where <span class="code"><em>your-wview-archive-name</em></span> is the 
      name of your wview archive database. Note that the word <span class="code">
	interval</span> is surrounded by backquotes.</p>
    <p>Then in the <span class="code">[Databases]</span> section of
      <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>, replace the name of the database 
      with whatever your installation of wview used <span class="code"><em>your-wview-archive-name</em></span>:</p>

    <h1 id="integrating_with_webserver">Integrating <span class='code'>weewx</span> with a web server</h1>
    <h2>If the server is on the same machine</h2>
    <p>The reports generated by <span class='code'>weewx</span> can be
      served by a web server running on the same computer as
      <span class='code'>weewx</span>. Here's how.</p>

    <p>First, install a web server on the computer on which 
      <span class='code'>weewx</span> is running.  For example, on Debian
      systems:</p>
    <p class='tty'>sudo apt-get install apache2</p>
    <p>Then, if <span class='code'>weewx</span> was installed from DEB or RPM
      package, simply enter the <span class='code'>weewx</span> URL in a web 
	browser in order to see your webpages.</p>
    <p class='tty'>http://localhost/weewx</p>
    <p>Alternatively, if <span class='code'>weewx</span> was installed using
      <span class='code'>setup.py</span>, copy the Apache configuration
      snippet that comes with <span class="code">weewx</span> to the apache configuration directory, then restart 
	Apache:</p>
    <p class='tty'>sudo cp util/apache/conf.d/weewx.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</p>
    <p>Be sure that the path in the Apache configuration snippet matches the <span class='code'>HTML_ROOT</span> defined in the
      <span class='code'>weewx</span> configuration file.</p>
    <p class='tty'>Alias /weewx <strong>/home/weewx/public_html</strong>
&lt;Directory <strong>/home/weewx/public_html</strong>&gt;
    Options FollowSymlinks
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;</p>
	  <p>Then open the <span class='code'>weewx</span> URL in a web browser:</p>
    <p class='tty'>http://localhost/weewx</p>

    <h2>If the server is on a different machine</h2>
    <p>Use the FTP or RSYNC 'reports' to upload to a web server.  Either of
      these will copy everything from the <span class='code'>HTML_ROOT</span>
      directory to a location on the remote server on which the web server
      is running.</p>


    <h1 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h1>
    <p>This section lists some common problems installing and running
      <span class="code">weewx</span>. If you are still stuck, be sure to: </p>
    <ul>
      <li style="margin-bottom:1em">Set the option <span class="code">debug</span> to
        <span class="code">1</span> in <span class='code'>weewx.conf</span>.
        This will put much more information in the log file, which can
        be very useful for troubleshooting and debugging!
        <p class='tty' style="margin-top:1em">debug = 1</p>
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom:1em"><a href="#monitoring">Look at the log file</a>. I am always
        happy to take questions, but the first thing I will ask you is,

      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom:1em">Run from the command line. Generally, <span class="code">weewx</span>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hardware problems</h2>
    <h3>Establishing connectivity</h3>
    <p>If you are unable to get anything out of <span class="code">weewx</span>, first 
      check that you have connectivity to your weather station. For the Davis stations, 
      you can use a terminal emulator (I like <span class="code">minicom</span> because 
      it can be run from through a simple TTY connection) to run a simple test. Set 
      it up to communicate using the appropriate port and baudrate. For example</p>
    <pre class="tty">minicom -b 19200 -D /dev/ttyUSB0</pre>
    <p>Then type in <span class="code">TEST</span>, all in capital letters. It will 
      not echo the characters. Then hit the <span class="code">&lt;enter&gt;</span> 
      key. It should echo back <span class="code">TEST</span>.</p>
    <p>If this works, then you have established connectivity with the Davis and 
      the problem must lie elsewhere.</p>

    <h3>Tips on making a system reliable</h3>
    <p>If you are having problems keeping your weather station up for long
      periods of time, here are some tips, in decreasing order of importance:
    </p>
    <p class='image-right' style='width:205px'>
      <a href="ferrites.jpg"><img src="ferrites.jpg" width='200' border='1' alt="Ferrite coils" longdesc="Cable connection looped through a ferrite coil" /></a>
      <br/>
      <span class='caption'>Ferrite coils on a Davis Envoy.  There are two
        coils, one on the USB connection (top wire) and one on the power
        supply. Both have loops.</span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Run on dedicated hardware. If you are using the server for other
        tasks, particularly as your desktop machine, you will have reliability
        problems. If you are using it as a print or network server, you will
        probably be OK.
      </li>
      <li>Run headless. Modern graphical systems are extremely complex. As new 
	features are added, test suites do not always catch up. Your system
        will be much more reliable if you run it without a windowing system (X
        Windows, in the case of Linux). </li>
      <li>Use an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). The vast majority of power
        glitches are very short lived &mdash; just a second or two &mdash; so
        you do not need a big one. The 425VA unit I use to protect my fit-PC
        cost $55 at Best Buy.</li>
      <li>Use a VantagePro console with a serial connection, not a USB
        connection. See the next section for details. </li>
      <li>If you do use a USB connection, put a ferrite coil on each end of
        the cable to your console. If you have enough length and the ferrite
        coil is big enough, make a loop so it goes through the coil twice.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>cp2101 converter problems</h3>
    <p>The USB converter used in the Davis VantagePro is known to have some &quot;noise&quot; 
      problems. The symptom is that the Linux kernel will disconnect from your old 
      USB port claiming &quot;EMI noise&quot;, and reconnect to a new and different 
      port, where <span class="code">weewx</span> cannot find it. Here is a 
      typical log output: </p>
    <p class='tty'>Nov 29 10:40:21 hummingbird kernel: [6661624.786792] hub 2-0:1.0: port 3 disabled by hub (EMI?), re-enabling...

Nov 29 10:40:21 hummingbird kernel: [6661624.795778] cp2101 2-3:1.0: device disconnected 
Nov 29 10:40:21 hummingbird weewx[25808]: VantagePro: Max retries exceeded while getting LOOP packets
... (messages elided)
Nov 29 10:40:22 hummingbird kernel: [6661625.352340] cp2101 2-3:1.0: cp2101 converter detected 
Nov 29 10:40:22 hummingbird kernel: [6661625.528107] usb 2-3: reset full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 3 
Nov 29 10:40:22 hummingbird kernel: [6661625.735497] usb 2-3: cp2101 converter now attached to ttyUSB1</p>
    <p>In this example, the VantagePro was connected to <span class="code">/dev/ttyUSB0</span>, 
      but then reconnected to <span class="code">/dev/ttyUSB1</span>. </p>
    <p>If you put ferrite coils on the USB connection, you will eliminate 90% of 
      this problem. I did this about 3 years ago, and have not had a problem since.
    </p>
    <p>However, there is one final step that you can take to really harden up 
      your system: install a <span class="code">udev</span> script that will create 
      a symbolic link to the VantagePro USB port, whatever it might be. With this 
      approach, if the port jumps from <span class="code">ttyUSB0</span> to
      <span class="code">ttyUSB1</span>, the symbolic link will follow it. You just 
      specify port <span class="code">/dev/vpro</span> in the configuration file
      <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> and be done with it. </p>
    <p>Here's how: </p>
    <h4>Installing a udev script</h4>
    <p>I have installed a file <span class="code">/etc/udev/rules.d/vpro.rules</span> 
      on my fit-PC that looks like this: </p>
    <p class='tty'># Automount the VantagePro2 to port /dev/vpro.
# Install in /etc/udev/rules.d/vpro.rules
#
ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, ATTRS{interface}==&quot;CP2102 USB to UART Bridge Controller&quot;, SYMLINK+=&quot;vpro&quot;</p>
    <p>What this rule says is that when the USB port is plugged in (action
      <span class="code">add</span>), and it has an attribute with name
      <span class="code">interface</span> that is equal to &quot;<span class="code">CP2102 
	USB to UART Bridge Controller</span>&quot;, then add a symbolic link for its 
      physical port to <span class="code">/dev/vpro</span>. </p>
    <p>Here is a rule that works for my Serial-to-USB cable, made by Prolific 
      Technology, Inc.:</p>
    <p class='tty'># Automount Serial-to-USB cable to port /dev/vpro
# Install in /etc/udev/rules.d/cable.rules
#
ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, ATTRS{product}==&quot;USB-Serial Controller&quot;, SYMLINK+=&quot;vpro&quot;</p>
    <p>Your devices may, and probably will, have different identifiers!! I can recommend 
      this article, &quot;<a href="http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html"><em>Writing 
	  udev rules</em></a>,&quot; for how to find and write an appropriate
      <span class="code">udev</span> rule for your controller. (Note, however, that 
      this article uses the old <span class="code">udevinfo</span> command, rather 
      than the newer <span class="code">udevadm</span> command.) In particular, run 
      the command </p>
    <p class='tty'># udevadm info --attribute-walk --path $(udevadm info --query=path --name=/dev/ttyUSB0) </p>
    <p>where<span class="code"> /dev/ttyUSB0</span> is the port (substitute your 
      real USB port) the VP2 is attached to. It will print out various identifiers 
      that can be useful in identifying your VP2 to <span class="code">udev</span>. 
      While the first example script above used a rule that matched attribute
      <span class="code">interface</span>, others are possible. For example, the second 
      example, for the serial-to-USB cable, chose to match the attribute
      <span class="code">product</span>. </p>
    <p>Once you have installed your <span class="code">udev</span> rule, you can 
      then set <span class="code">port=/dev/vpro</span> in <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>, 
      confident that it will always point to your VantagePro2, no matter which USB 
      port it is actually attached to! </p>
    <p>I have tested this system many times. You can yank the USB port out of the 
      machine and then plug it back in while also pulling out the network connection 
      in the middle of an FTP upload: <span class="code">weewx</span> will recover.
    </p>
    <p>Or, at least, it should! </p>
    <h3 id="html_generated_but_not_updated">Weewx generates HTML pages, but it does not update them</h3>
    <p>If you are getting a symptom that everything appears normal, that is HTML 
      is getting generated and getting FTP&#39;d to your webserver <em>(look in the 
	log to be sure</em>!), but your web pages are not being updated, it could be 
      because the data on board your console has gotten garbled. The way the Davis 
      Vantage series works is that the software (<span class="code">weewx</span> in 
      this case) asks the console for all archive data &quot;since&quot; some time. 
      The console then downloads the records one at a time. After it gets to the very 
      last one, the memory wraps around, and the timestamp will suddenly jump backwards 
      in time a couple weeks &mdash; this how the software knows it has downloaded the last 
      record and so it stops.</p>
    <p>However, if the internal memory gets garbled, the console will immediately 
      return archives in the past, and so it looks like the timestamps have decreased 
      in value and so <span class="code">weewx</span> figures that is it: there is 
      no more data.</p>
    <p>I have received reports from a couple of users who have had this problem. 
      There seems to be two fixes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Unplug the console, take out the batteries, and wait a minute or two. 
	This will cause the console software to internally reboot. In one case this 
	has fixed the problem without data loss.</li>
      <li>If all else fails, clear the memory of the console using the utility
	<span class="code">wee_config_vantage</span>. This may cause loss of data, but 
	usually works. Adjust paths as necessary:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_vantage --clear </pre>
	  <p>See also the section <em><a href="#Dumping_the_logger_memory">Dumping 
	  the logger memory</a></em>, which may help you avoid data loss.</p>
    <h3>3rd party Vantage connectors</h3>
    <p>This section is for those who are using a homebrew or 3rd party connector 
      to a Davis Vantage console that does not contain a logger, such as the
      <a href="http://www.wxforum.net/index.php?topic=14063.0">DSI-01 serial interface</a>. 
      That is, it is a pure serial connection to the console, with no onboard memory.
    </p>
    <p>For these interfaces, you must set record generation to <em>software</em>. 
      Without this information, <span class="code">weewx</span> is unable to detect 
      the absence of onboard memory. If you do not do this, you will get errors that 
      look like the following in your syslog:</p>

	<h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
	  <p>Running <span class="code">weewx</span> on a Raspberry Pi has become 
	  very popular. You'll have to look elsewhere for instructions on setting up 
	  your RPi (I don't own one), but there is one very common problem with 
	  them.</p>
	  <p class="warning">You must run NTP on your RPi, and you must make sure it 
	  starts and updates the time <em>before</em> <span class="code">weewx</span> 
	  runs.</p>
	  <p>The reason is that the RPi does not have an onboard clock. If you lose 
	  power and, say, an hour later it comes back, your RPi will simply pick up 
	  where it left off — one hour behind. The symptom that something is amiss 
	  is that everything will appear to be running normally, but your webpage 
	  will not get updated (at least, until the length of the power failure has 
	  elapsed).
	  <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/weewx-user/clock/weewx-user/tmbrOC6-UiM/1xohs9WUAW8J">
	  Here's one user's nice analysis of the problem.</a></p>
	  <p>What this means is that it is not enough to simply run the 
	  <span class="code">weewx</span> 
	  daemon. You need some way of delaying its start until NTP is not only up 
	  and running, but has contacted a time server and corrected the RPi's 
	  clock. </p>
	  <p>Several users are working on a solution to this problem. Perhaps you'll 
	  be the one to figure it out?!</p>
	
    <h2>Software problems</h2>
    <h3><span class="code">configobj</span> errors</h3>
    <p>These are errors in the configuration file. Two are very common. Incidentally, 
      these errors are far easier to diagnose when <span class="code">weewx</span> 
      is run from the command line. </p>
    <h4><span class="code">configobj.DuplicateError</span> exception</h4>
    <p>This error is caused by using an identifier more than once in the configuration 
      file. For example, you may have inadvertently listed your FTP server twice:
    </p>
    <p class='tty'>[Reports]
    [[FTP]]
        ... (details elided)
        user = fred
        server = ftp.myhost.com
        password = mypassword
        server = ftp.myhost.com  # OOPS! Listed it twice!
        path = /weather
        ... </p>
    <p>Generally, if you encounter this error, the log file will give you the line 
      number it happened in: </p>
    <p class='tty'>Apr 24 12:09:15 raven weewx[11480]: wxengine: Error while parsing configuration file /home/weewx/weewx.conf

    <h4><span class="code">configobj.NestingError</span> exception</h4>
    <p>This is a very similar error, and is caused by a misformed section nesting. 
      For example: </p>
    <p class='tty'>[Reports]
   [[FTP]]]
      ... (details elided)</p>
    <p>Note the extra closing bracket on the subsection <span class="code">FTP</span>.
    </p>
    <h3>No barometer data</h3>
    <p>If everything appears normal except that you have no barometer data, the 
      problem may be a mismatch between the unit system used for service
      <span class="code">StdConvert</span> and the unit system used by service
      <span class="code">StdQC</span>. For example:</p>
    <pre class="tty">[StdConvert]
    target_unit = METRIC
    ...

[StdQC]
    [[MinMax]]
        barometer = 28, 32.5</pre>
    <p>The problem is that you are requiring the barometer data to be between 28 
      and 32.5, but with the unit system set to <span class="code">METRIC</span>, 
      the data will be in the range 990 to 1050 or so!</p>
    <h3><span class="code">Cheetah.NameMapper.NotFound</span> errors</h3>
    <p>If you get errors of the sort: </p>
    <p class='tty'>Apr 12 05:12:32 raven reportengine[3074]: filegenerator: Caught exception &quot;&lt;class &#39;NameMapper.NotFound&#39;&gt;&quot;

Apr 12 05:12:32 raven reportengine[3074]:   ****  Ignoring template and continuing.</p>
    <p>you have a tag in your template that <span class="code">weewx</span> does 
      not recognize (in this example, it is the tag <span class="code">$fubar</span> 
      in the template <span class="code">/home/weewx/skins/Standard/index.html.tmpl</span>.

    <h3>FreeBSD</h3>
    <p>User Fabian reports that the following had to be done to get the VantagePro2 
      working under FreeBSD:</p>
    <pre class="tty">I needed the uslcom Driver for the usb/rs232 Adapter used by my vantage. Also I had to reset the memory of the weatherstation.
Loading the Driver:
Put uslcom_load=&quot;YES&quot; in /boot/loader.conf (to load it as module).
Which gives here an output like:
uslcom0: &lt;CP2102 USB to UART Bridge Controller&gt; on usbus1
And put in weewx.conf:
port = /dev/cuaU0</pre>


    <h1 id="architecture">Architectural Notes</h1>
    <p>This section is not needed to get started. </p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>The primary design goals of <span class="code">weewx </span>are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Architectural simplicity. No semaphores, no named pipes, no inter-process 
	communications, no complex multi-threading to manage. </li>
      <li>Extensibility. Make it easy for the user to add new features or to modify 
	existing features.</li>
      <li>&quot;Fast enough.&quot; In any design decision, architectural simplicity 
	and elegance trump speed. </li>
      <li>One code base. The same code base should be used for all platforms, 
	all weather stations, all reports, and any combination of features. Ample 
	configuration and customization options should be provided so the user does not 
	feel tempted to start hacking code. At worse, the user may have to subclass, 
	which is much easier to port to newer versions of the code base, than customizing 
	the base code. </li>
      <li>Minimal reliance on external packages, so the user does not have 
	to go chase them down all over the Web before getting started. </li>
      <li>Support only the Davis VantagePro2 initially (that is what I have), 
	but make no architectural decisions that lock out other stations. </li>
      <li>As &quot;pythonic&quot; as I know how to make it. I am a beginner 
	Python programmer with two decades of experience in C++. I tried hard to 
	not make the code base look like it was written by a C++ programmer who 
	stumbled across a Python manual! </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>To meet these goals, the following strategies were used: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A &quot;micro-kernel&quot; design. The <span class="code">weewx</span> 
	engine actually does very little. Its primary job is to load and run <em>
	  services</em> at runtime, making it easy for users to add or subtract features.
      </li>
      <li>A largely stateless design style. For example, many of the processing 
	routines read the data they need directly from the database, rather than 
	caching it and sharing with other routines. While this means the same data 
	may be read multiple times, it also means the only point of possible cache 
	incoherence is through the database, where transactions are easily controlled. 
	This greatly reduces the chances of corrupting the data, making it much 
	easier to understand and modify the code base. </li>
      <li>Isolate the data collection and archiving code in a single thread that 
	is simple enough that it is unlikely to crash. The report processing is 
	where most mistakes are likely to happen, so isolate that in a separate 
	thread. If it crashes, it will not affect the main data thread. </li>
      <li>A powerful configuration parser,
	<a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html">ConfigObj</a>, 
	by Michael Foord and Nicola Larosa, was chosen to read the configuration 
	file. This allows many options that might otherwise have to go in the code 
	to go instead in a configuration file. </li>
      <li>A powerful templating engine,
	<a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah</a>, was used. This allows 
	many variables that I may not have thought of to be accessed from within 
	the HTML templates, without starting to modify the code. </li>
      <li>Pure Python. The code base is 100% Python &mdash; no underlying C libraries 
	need be built to install <span class="code">weewx</span>. This also means 
	no Makefiles are needed. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>While <span class="code">weewx</span> is nowhere near as fast at generating 
      images and HTML as its predecessor, <span class="code">wview</span> (this is 
      partially because <span class="code">weewx</span> uses fancier fonts and a much more powerful templating 
      engine), it is fast enough for all platforms but the slowest. I run 
      it regularly on a 500 MHz machine where generating the 9 images used in the &quot;Current 
      Conditions&quot; page takes just under 2 seconds (compared with
      0.4 seconds for <span class="code">wview</span>). </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the architectural goal of one code base is likely to be broken 
      with the arrival of Python V3.X. It has so many changes that are not backwards 
      compatible with V2.X, that a separate code base will most likely be needed. 
      My intention is to stick with the V2.X versions until V3.X is so widespread 
      it cannot be ignored, then make a permanent switch. Given the slow adoption 
      rate of V3.X this is unlikely to happen anytime soon. In any case, I doubt the 
      transition will affect the average <span class="code">weewx</span> user. </p>
    <p>All writes to the databases are protected by transactions. You can kill the 
      program at any time (either Control-C if run from the command line or &quot;<span class="code">/etc/init.d/weewx 
	stop</span>&quot; if a daemon) without fear of corrupting the databases. </p>
    <p>The code makes ample use of exceptions to insure graceful recovery from problems 
      such as network outages. It also monitors socket and console timeouts, restarting 
      whatever it was working on several times before giving up. In the case of an 
      unrecoverable console error (such as the console not responding at all), the 
      program waits 60 seconds then restarts the program from the top.</p>
    <p>Any &quot;hard&quot; exceptions, that is those that do not involve network 
      and console timeouts and are most likely due to a logic error, are logged, reraised, 
      and ultimately cause thread termination. If this happens in the main thread 
      (not likely due to its simplicity), then this causes program termination. If 
      it happens in the report processing thread (much more likely), then only the 
      generation of reports will be affected &mdash; the main thread will continue downloading 
      data off the instrument and putting them in the database. You can fix the problem 
      at your leisure, without worrying about losing any data. </p>

          time used in the databases and appears as type <span class="code">

      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Units</h2>
    <p>In general, there are three different areas where the unit system makes a 
      difference.: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>On the weather station. As far as I know, the Davis Vantage series supports 
	only U.S. Customary units internally. The Oregon Scientific WMR-USB series 
	uses an odd mix of US and metric.</li>
      <li>In the database. Either US or Metric can be used.</li>
      <li>In the presentation (i.e., html and image files). </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The general strategy is that measurements are converted by service
      <span class="code">StdConvert</span> as they come off the weather station into 
      a target unit system, then stored internally in the database. Then, as they 
      come off the database to be used for a report, they are converted into a target 
      unit, specified by the skin. </p>
    <h2>Value &quot;<span class="code">None</span>&quot;</h2>
    <p>The Python special value <span class="code">None</span> is used 
      throughout to signal a missing data point. All functions expect it. </p>
    <p>However, the time value must never be <span class="code">None</span>. 
      This is because it is used as the primary key in the SQL database. </p>
    <h2>Time</h2>
    <p><span class="code">Weewx </span>stores all data in UTC (roughly, &quot;Greenwich&quot; 
      or &quot;Zulu&quot;) time. However, usually one is interested in weather events 
      in local time and want image and HTML generation to reflect that. Furthermore, 
      most weather stations are configured in local time. This requires that many 
      data times be converted back and forth between UTC and local time. To avoid 
      tripping up over time zones and daylight savings time, <span class="code">weewx</span> 
      generally uses Python routines to do this conversion. Nowhere in the code base 
      is there any explicit recognition of DST. Instead, its presence is implicit 
      in the conversions. At times, this can cause the code to be relatively inefficient.
    </p>
    <p>For example, if one wanted to plot something every 3 hours in UTC time, it 
      would be very simple: to get the next plot point, just add 10,800 to the epoch 
      time: </p>
    <pre class="tty">next_ts = last_ts + 10800 </pre>
    <p>But, if one wanted to plot something for every 3 hours <em>in local time</em> 
      (that is, at 0000, 0300, 0600, etc.), despite a possible DST change in the middle, 
      then things get a bit more complicated. One could modify the above to recognize 
      whether a DST transition occurs sometime between <span class="code">last_ts</span> 
      and the next three hours and, if so, make the necessary adjustments. This is 
      generally what <span class="code">wview</span> does. <span class="code">Weewx
      </span>takes a different approach and converts from UTC to local, does the arithmetic, 
      then converts back. This is inefficient, but bulletproof against changes in 
      DST algorithms, etc: </p>
    <pre class="tty">time_dt = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(last_ts)
delta = datetime.timedelta(seconds=10800)
next_dt = time_dt + delta
next_ts = int(time.mktime(next_dt.timetuple()))</pre>
    <p>Other time conversion problems are handled in a similar manner. </p>
